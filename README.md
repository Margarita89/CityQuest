# CityQuest
 *CityQuest* is my attempt to make cities more interacting and friendly for travelers. It is a game that will use the power of AI to make user's experience more personalized. After selecting of the city the model will generate questions, answers and hints and the game will guide the user from one location to another letting the user learn exciting facts about the surroundings.

## What has been already done:
1. Logic of the game was developed using Transitions module [link to Transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) in Python which allows user to enter answers, ask for hints or skip questions
1. The UI was created by streamlit [link to Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) framework
1. App was put to the Docker container for the simpler cloud deployment
	
## Next steps:
1. Deploy the project in Google cloud
1. Implement autoscaling with Kubernetes
1. Collect the data set with facts about points of interest and add several questions for it
1. Fine-tune question-generation model for the dataset
1. Replace hardcoded questions with stochastic questions, generated by the model
1. Add users position on the map via geolocation
